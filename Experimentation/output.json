Yesugei died when Tem\u00fcjin was eight, and his family was abandoned by their tribe in the Mongol steppe. Tem\u00fcjin gradually built up a small following and allied with Jamukha and Toghrul, two other Mongol chieftains, in campaigns against other Mongol tribes. Due to the erratic nature of the sources, this period of Tem\u00fcjin's life is uncertain; he may have spent this time as a servant of the Jin dynasty. The alliances with Jamukha and Toghrul failed completely in the early 13th century, but Tem\u00fcjin was able to defeat both individuals and claim sole rulership over the Mongol tribes. He formally adopted the title \"Genghis Khan\" at a kurultai in 1206."

Having vassalised the Western Xia state by 1211, he then invaded the Jin dynasty in northern China, forcing the Jin emperor Xuanzong to abandon the northern half of his realm in 1214. In 1218, Qara Khitai, a Central Asian khanate, was annexed by Mongol forces, allowing Genghis to lead an invasion of the neighbouring Khwarazmian Empire in the following year. The invading Mongols toppled the Khwarazmian state and devastated the regions of Transoxiana and Khorasan, while another expedition penetrated as far as Georgia and Kievan Rus'. In 1227, Genghis died while besieging the rebellious Western Xia; his third son and heir \u00d6gedei succeeded him to the throne two years later."

As Arabic lacks a sound similar to \"\u010d\", writers using the language transliterated the name to J\u030cingiz, while Syriac writers used \u0160\u012bng\u012bz.[3] In modern English, common spellings include Chinggis, Chingis, Jinghis, and Jengiz, in addition to the dominant Genghis, which was introduced into English by 18th-century scholars who misread Persian sources.[4] His birth name \u1832\u1821\u182e\u1826\u1835\u1822\u1828 (Chinese: \u9435\u6728\u771f; Mongolian pronunciation: [t\u02b0emut\u0361\u0283i\u014b]) is most commonly spelt Tem\u00fcjin in English, although Temuchin is also sometimes used.[5]"

Some traditions place his birth in the Year of the Pig, which was either 1155 or 1167.[18] While a dating to 1155 is supported by the writings of both Rashid al-Din and the Chinese diplomat Zhao Hong, other major sources such as the Yuan Shi and the Shengwu favour the year 1162.[19][b] The 1167 dating, favoured by Paul Pelliot, is derived from a minor source\u2014a text of the Yuan artist Yang Weizhen\u2014but is far more compatible with the events of Genghis Khan's life. For example, an 1155 placement implies that he did not have children until after the age of thirty and continued actively campaigning into his seventh decade.[20] Pelliot was nevertheless uncertain of the accuracy of his theory, which remains controversial; the historian Paul Ratchnevsky notes that Tem\u00fcjin himself may not have known the truth.[21] The location of Tem\u00fcjin's birth is similarly debated: the Secret History records his birthplace as Del\u00fc\u00fcn Boldog on the Onon River, but this has been placed at either Dadal in Khentii Province or in southern Agin-Buryat Okrug, Russia.[22]"

The most prominent is that of a blood clot he clutched in his hand as he was born, an Asian folklorish motif which indicated the child would be a warrior.[25] Others claimed that Hoelun was impregnated by a ray of light which announced the child's destiny, a legend which echoed that of the mythical ancestor Alan Gua.[26] Yes\u00fcgei and Hoelun had three younger sons after Tem\u00fcjin: Qasar, Hachiun, and Tem\u00fcge, as well as one daughter, Tem\u00fclen. Tem\u00fcjin also had two half-brothers, Behter and Belgutei, from Yes\u00fcgei's second wife Sochigel, whose identity is uncertain. The siblings grew up at Yesugei's main camp on the banks of the Onon, where they learned how to ride a horse and shoot a bow.[27]\nPainting of an old woman with golden dress and white headscarf on a balcony next to an old man wearing a green tunic and a white turban\nA 16th century depiction of B\u00f6rte and Genghis Khan in later life"

As the betrothal meant Yes\u00fcgei would gain a powerful ally, and as B\u00f6rte commanded a high bride price, Dei Sechen held the stronger negotiating position, and demanded that Tem\u00fcjin remain in his household to work off his future bride's dowry.[28] Accepting this condition, Yes\u00fcgei requested a meal from a band of Tatars he encountered while riding homewards alone, relying on the steppe tradition of hospitality to strangers. However, the Tatars recognised their old enemy, and slipped poison into his food. Yes\u00fcgei gradually sickened but managed to return home; close to death, he requested a trusted retainer called M\u00fcnglig to retrieve Tem\u00fcjin from the Onggirat.

The Secret History relates that the entire Borjigin clan followed, despite Hoelun's attempts to shame them into staying with her family.[30] Rashid al-Din and the Shengwu qinzheng lu however imply that Yes\u00fcgei's brothers stood by the widow. It is possible that Hoelun may have refused to join in levirate marriage with one, or that the author of the Secret History dramatised the situation.[31] All the sources agree that most of Yes\u00fcgei's people renounced his family in favour of the Tayichiuds and that Hoelun's family were reduced to a much harsher life.[32] Taking up a traditional hunter-gatherer lifestyle, they collected roots and nuts, hunted for small animals, and caught fish.[33]"

Both Tem\u00fcjin and Behter had claims to be their father's heir: although Tem\u00fcjin was the child of Yes\u00fcgei's chief wife, Behter was at least two years his senior. There was even the possibility that, as permitted under levirate law, Behter could marry Hoelun upon attaining his majority and become Tem\u00fcjin's stepfather.[34] As the friction, excarbated by regular disputes over the division of hunting spoils, intensified, Tem\u00fcjin and his younger brother Qasar ambushed and killed Behter. This taboo act was omitted from the official chronicles but not from the Secret History, which recounts that Hoelun angrily reprimanded her sons. Behter's younger full-brother Belgutei did not seek vengeance, and became one of Tem\u00fcjin's highest-ranking followers alongside Qasar.[35] Around this time, Tem\u00fcjin developed a close friendship with Jamukha, another boy of aristocratic descent; the Secret History notes that they exchanged knucklebones and arrows as gifts and swore the anda pact\u2014the traditional oath of Mongol blood brothers\u2013at the age of eleven.[36]"

Soon afterwards, Bo'orchu joined Tem\u00fcjin's camp as his first n\u00f6kor (personal companion; PL n\u00f6kod).[39] These incidents are indicative of the emphasis the author of Secret History put on personal charisma.[40]\nRise to power\nEarly campaigns\nPhotograph of a landscape in winter, with trees bare, and valleys and mountains covered in snow.\nBurkhan Khaldun mountain, where Tem\u00fcjin hid during the Merkit attack, and which he later came to honour as sacred"

Toghrul ruled hundreds of miles and commanded up to 20,000 warriors, but he was suspicious of the loyalty of his chief followers and, after being presented with the sable cloak, he welcomed Tem\u00fcjin into his protection.

In accordance with levirate law, B\u00f6rte was given to Chilger, younger brother of Chiledu.[43] Tem\u00fcjin appealed for aid from Toghrul and his childhood anda Jamukha, who had risen to become chief of the Jadaran tribe. Both chiefs were willing to field armies of 20,000 warriors, and with Jamukha in command, the campaign was soon won.

Traditionally seen as an expression of Song arrogance, the statement is now thought to be based in fact, especially as no other source convincingly explains Tem\u00fcjin's activities between Dalan Baljut and c. 1195.[51] Taking refuge across the border was a common practice both for disaffected steppe leaders and disgraced Chinese officials.

Aware that a different organisational structure was required for the functioning of his new nation, Genghis began a series of administrative reforms designed to suppress the power of tribal loyalties and to replace them with unconditional loyalty to the khan and the ruling family.[75] As most of the traditional tribal leaders had been killed during his rise to power, Genghis was able to reconstruct the Mongol social hierarchy in his favour. The highest tier was occupied solely by the families of the Khan and his brothers, who became known as the altan uruq (lit. \"Golden Family\") or chaghan yasun (lit. \"white bone\"); underneath them came the qara yasun (lit. \"black bone\"; sometimes qarachu), composed of the surviving pre-empire aristocracy and the most important of the new families.[76]"

Each minqan operated as both political and social units, while the warriors of defeated tribes were dispersed to different minqad so that they could not rebel as a single body. This was intended to ensure the disappearance of old tribal identities, replacing them with loyalty to the Yeke Mongol Ulus (lit. \"Great Mongol State\") and to commanders who had gained their rank through meritocratic skill and loyalty to the khan.[78] This particular reformation proved extremely effective\u2014even after the division of the Mongol Empire, fragmentation never happened along tribal lines. Instead, the Borjigin Genghisids continued to reign unchallenged, in some cases until as late as the 1700s, and even powerful non-imperial dynasts such as Timur and Edigu were compelled to rule from behind a Genghisid puppet ruler.[79]"

Tolui was unquestionably superior in military terms\u2014his campaign in Khorasan had broken the Khwarazmian Empire, while his elder brother was far less able as a commander.[174] Ogedei was also known to drink excessively even by Mongol standards\u2014it was eventually the cause of his death in 1241.[175] However, he possessed talents all his brothers lacked\u2014he was generous and courteous, well-liked by all in the nation. Aware of his own lack of military skill, he was able to trust his capable subordinates, and unlike his elder brothers, compromise on issues; he was also more likely to preserve Mongol traditions than Tolui, whose wife Sorghaghtani, herself a Nestorian Christian, was a patron of many religions including Islam.[176]"

        "passage_text": "Serving as regent after Genghis' death, Tolui established a precedent for the customary traditions after khan's death. These included: the halting of all offensive military actions involving Mongol troops, the establishment of a lengthy mourning period, which the regent would oversee, and the holding of a kurultai which would nominate successors and select them.[177] For Tolui, this presented an opportunity. He was still a viable candidate for succession and had the support of the family of Jochi. Any general kurultai, attended by the commanders Genghis had promoted and honoured, would however observe their former ruler's desires without question and appoint Ogedei as ruler. It has been suggested that Tolui's reluctance to hold the kurultai was driven by the knowledge of the threat it posed to his ambitions.[178] In the end, Tolui had to be convinced by Yelu Chucai to hold the kurultai; in 1229, it crowned Ogedei as khan, with Tolui in attendance.[179]\nLegacy\nMedieval depictions and assessment\nGenghis Khan and Great Khans of the Yuan dynasty, late 13th and early 14th-century Yuan paintings"

        "passage_text": "Genghis Khan never allowed his image to be depicted in any medium; as a result, any painting, sculpture, or engravings are interpretations of the writings of historians, most writing long after his death.[180] The two earliest statements come from the Persian chronicler Juzjani, who relied on Khorasani eyewitnesses, and the contemporary Song diplomat Zhao Hong\u2014both record that he was tall and strong with a powerful stature. Juzjani additionally remarks on the khan's \"cat's eyes\", mirroring a similar statement Dei Sechen, Genghis' father-in-law, is recorded saying on meeting him as a nine-year old.[181] Another written description is found in the Jami al-tawarikh, which states that Genghis Khan and his Borjigin ancestors had blue-green eyes and either red hair or a ruddy complexion which Kublai Khan did not inherit. The factual nature of this description is considered controversial.[182][183]"
