## Redefining Text Search

### Inspiration
🌟 We found ourselves using Ctrl+F way too often while searching for information online.

### What it does
🚀 CoRead is a game-changer for text searching. It analyzes webpages, making it a breeze to find specific information while also providing citations and confidence levels. Imagine effortlessly parsing through lengthy academic papers. For a simplified view of the process, check out this graphic:

### How we built it
🔧 Building CoRead was a journey of learning. We leveraged pre-made AI models due to our limited team size and inexperience with AI. It was also our first time coding a browser extension. Our toolbox included:
- Cohere API
- HuggingFace Hub
- PineCone DB
- Flask
- NodeJS
- ngrok

### Challenges we ran into
💡 To put it succinctly, we faced challenges as beginners in both AI and extension development. Additionally, we had half of our team depart within the first two hours.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
🏆 Despite the hurdles, our backend works, and we proudly present an AI-powered API. Performance-wise, it can analyze Wikipedia in just 20 seconds (on my modest CPU) and provides answers within 2 seconds.

### What we learned
🧠 CoRead opened our eyes to the potential of AI in improving everyday tasks. People use Ctrl+F daily, and once we fine-tune it, we'll integrate it into our personal lives.

### What's next for CoRead
🌐 We primarily tested this on Wikipedia, especially the Genghis Khan page, which we humorously call "Super Genghis Khan." To make it universally useful, we're exploring open-source alternatives.
